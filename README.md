## :pushpin: About
Quantum key distribution provides a way of distributing and sharing secret keys that are necessary for cryptographic protocols. The importance here is in ensuring that they remain private, i.e. between the communicating parties. . 
In the BB84 protocol, Alice can transmit a random secret key to Bob by sending a string of photons with the secret key is encoded in their polarization. The no-cloning theorem guarantees that Eve cannot measure these photons and transmit them to Bob without disturbing the photonâ€™s state in a detectable way.
